title: Deep Learning Model for Lung Nodule Detection from CT Scans
permalink: /projects/luna/

The code for this project can be found on my github. Click [here](https://github.com/elliotchen02/LUNA) to check it out. 


I've been trying to build more advanced deep learning models. I recently discovered Kaggle and I'm really interested in machine learning competitions. It's really cool how Kaggle is highly competitive (which drives discovery) but also highly collaborative at the same time. 

This project is a work in progress. I am attempting to build a deep learning model that solves the LUNA 2016 Grand Challenge. Information about this challenge can be found [here](https://luna16.grand-challenge.org/Data/). 

### The Goal

The goal of this project is to identify lung nodules from CT scans. Lung nodules are excess cell growths that are found in the lungs. As with any excess cell growth, some may be classified as tumors, and some tumors may be benign or malignant. The goal of this project is to identify malignant lung tumors. 

I will be updating this project post as it is completed.

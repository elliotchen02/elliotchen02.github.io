I am an undergraduate student studying computer science at MIT. My interests include machine learning, quantitative finance, full-stack software development, and green technology. I value working on projects for social, cultural, and environmental good. 

In my free time, I enjoy swimming, lifting, hiking, playing poker, and a good movie. I write about some of these things on this site too. 

If you'd like to contact me, I'm most reachable by email:  <echen02@mit.edu>

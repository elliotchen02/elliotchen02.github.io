I am a student pursuing both a B.S. and M.Eng. in computer science and engineering at MIT. My interests include machine learning, full-stack software development, and computer architecture. I value working on projects for social, cultural, and environmental good. Currently, I'm interested in applying machine learning (graph neural networks) to study when governmental lobbying is most effective.

In my free time, I enjoy swimming, lifting, hiking, playing poker, and a good movie. I might write about some of these things on this site too. 

If you'd like to contact me, I'm most reachable by email:

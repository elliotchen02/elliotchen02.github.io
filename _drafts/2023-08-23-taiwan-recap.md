When I finally stepped outside after my hazy fourteen hour flight, I remember feeling incredibly lost. It was 5 A.M. Getting my bags, calling a taxi, negotiating the price, my brain had not yet adjusted to reading and speaking Mandarin. Culture shock perhaps -- seeing the sprawling Taipei basin glisten in the rising sun, the hundreds of motorcycles on the streets buzzing through traffic, the dense streets jammed with hole-in-the-wall eats opening for the day. I remember feeling overwhelmed. When I finally dropped my bags in my new flat, I shut the door, laid in bed, and listened to the city wake up outside my window. 

 My first chance to travel to Taiwan was in January. Sponsored by MIT's Chinese department, the program took a dozen students to the southern city of Kaoshiung for cultural and language immersion. Because my family is Taiwanese by descent, the trip was a special opportunity to see and experience Taiwanese culture firsthand. I tasted fantastic foods, picked up some new Mandarin vocabulary, and met extended family for the first time. When I returned to the U.S. a couple weeks later, I had a newfound interest in Taiwan, a rededicated will to master Mandarin, and a strong desire to go back. 

Around that time, I decided to switch my major from chemical engineering to computer science.
